// css architecture based on http://philipwalton.com/articles/css-architecture/ and http://nicolasgallagher.com/about-html-semantics-front-end-architecture/
// also takes inspiration on smacss for the folder structure https://smacss.com/ and object oriented css OOCSS, http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2011/12/an-introduction-to-object-oriented-css-oocss/
// and several other sources, http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2013/10/challenging-css-best-practices-atomic-approach/,
